Python Automation Project — Rental Property Tracker

Built an automated web scraping system using Python, Playwright, and BeautifulSoup to monitor rental property listings on a real estate platform.

Implemented deduplication logic to detect and notify only newly added listings.

Integrated email alerts and generated structured CSV reports for new data.

Deployed with GitHub Actions to run on a fixed daily schedule (3× per day) with artifact management.

Designed a lightweight state-tracking mechanism to persist results across runs.
